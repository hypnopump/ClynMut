## ClynMut: Predicting the Clynical Relevance of Genome Mutations (wip)

To be a next-generation DL-based phenotype prediction from genome mutations. Will use sota NLP and structural techniques. 


Planned modules will likely be: 
* Standard linear layers
* 3D learning module 
* NLP embeddings
* hierarchical classification (probably gaussian processes, but not sure yet. could do mlps for now as well)

The main idea is for the model to learn the prediction in an end-to-end fashion. 


## Important topics: 
### 3D structure learning

There are a couple architectures that can be used here. I've been working on 2 of them, which are likely to be used here: 
* <a href="https://github.com/lucidrains/geometric-vector-perceptron">GVP</a>
* <a href="https://github.com/lucidrains/egnn-pytorch">E(n)-gnn</a> 

### Hierarchical classification

I'm working on a prototype of a hierarchical classification small library that will support differentiablity.

### Testing

```bash
$ python setup.py test
```

### Datasets: 

This package will use the awesome work by <a href="http://github.com/jonathanking">Jonathan King</a> at <a href="https://github.com/jonathanking/sidechainnet">this repository</a>.

To install

```bash
$ pip install git+https://github.com/jonathanking/sidechainnet.git
```
Or

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/jonathanking/sidechainnet.git
$ cd sidechainnet && pip install -e .
```
